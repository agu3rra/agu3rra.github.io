# Welcome to my Blog!

I'm passionate about software development, and infrastructure, with a strong focus on security and automation.
Programmatically solving problems is what I like to do best. Python üêç is my primary language of choice and I'm a huge fan of its community and how it allows one to solve complex problems in a simple fashion.

I wrote this blog in an attempt to share topics that I've seen come up repeatedly in discussions with peers.
The main idea is to spread a bit of what I learned over the years.

Checkout my [Github profile](https://github.com/agu3rra) to see what I've been up to. Feel free to send me a connection request on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/agu3rra) if you want to keep in touch.

Cheers! \o/

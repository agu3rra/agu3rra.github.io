# Welcome
Welcome to my Blog!

I'm a security engineer, passionate about software development with a strong focus on security and automation.

Programmatically solving problems is what I like to do best. Python is my primary language of choice and I'm a huge fan of its community and how it allows one to solve complex problems in a simple fashion.
